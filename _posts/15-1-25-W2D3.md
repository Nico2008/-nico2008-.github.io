Response to the **[Article](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-cybersecurity.html)**  we read in class. 

In reading this article a couple of things stood out to me. The first is why no one could catch this virus, we now know that this hack began in 2014, and we only caught wind of it in 2023. 9 years of data from hundreds of thousands of computers seems crazy. The second thing that I find interesting is that the French government found out in 2023, and could only find a solution till 2024. Did they tell the public that they were working on it when they realized what was going on? Or did they keep it a secret until they were able to find a solution? I feel like they needed to tell the public immediately once they found out, that this was our personnel data and information that was being hacked for almost a decade.
