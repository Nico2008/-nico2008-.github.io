Response to U.S. Cyber Trust Mark
This seems like a great idea from the Department. I think that creating a system that further secures the american peoples information is great. The statment release also showed the backing of a couple big name comapnies, with the help of companies like amazon and best buy, they will help spread the word, while also pottentialy helping with some logistical ideas. In reading the article I was not quite able to to understand how this program works, is it a database that you are able to test your goods against, or is it more of a class that informs companies how to better secure there assests. Overall I think this is a good step in the right direction, and the fact that the US is focusing its resoucres in the matter is definitely a good thing.
