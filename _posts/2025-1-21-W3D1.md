# Bandit Writeup by Nico Anders
# Explanation and Thought Process Behind Each Level
### **Level 0 → Level 1**

- **What you did**: You logged in via SSH using the username `bandit0` and password `ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If` (provided from the readme file).
- **Why you did it**: This is the very first step of the game. You're simply starting by reading the `readme` file that contains the password for the next level.

---

### **Level 1 → Level 2**

- **What you did**: You used `cat ./-` to read the file named `./-`.
- **Why you did it**: The file is named with a hyphen (`-`), which in many Unix-like systems is interpreted as a command-line option. To handle this, you must quote the file name (`cat ./-`), or use `./-` directly to specify that it is a file. This shows how to handle filenames with special characters.

---

### **Level 2 → Level 3**

- **What you did**: You used `cat "spaces in this filename"`.
- **Why you did it**: The filename contains spaces, which can cause issues when reading the file. You need to either escape the spaces or enclose the entire filename in quotes to make sure it's interpreted correctly by the shell. This step teaches how to handle filenames with spaces.

---

### **Level 3 → Level 4**

- **What you did**: You navigated to the `inhere` directory, then used `ls -a` to list all files (including hidden ones). You found a hidden file `.hidden` and read it using `cat .hidden`.
- **Why you did it**: In this level, you're expected to find a hidden file. The `-a` option with `ls` lists all files, including hidden ones (those starting with a dot). The `.hidden` file contains the password, and `cat` is used to display its contents.

---

### **Level 4 → Level 5**

- **What you did**: You used `file ./*` to find out which file is human-readable and used `cat ./-file07` to read it.
- **Why you did it**: The goal here was to find a human-readable file among many others. The `file` command tells you the type of each file, and by identifying the correct file type (ASCII text, for example), you can easily open it with `cat`.

---

### **Level 5 → Level 6**

- **What you did**: You used `du -b -a` to find a file that is exactly 1033 bytes in size, and then you read its contents with `cat ./maybehere07/.file2`.
- **Why you did it**: This challenge requires you to locate a file with a specific size. The `du -b -a` command lists all files with their byte sizes, and then you use `cat` to read the file that matches the size. This tests your ability to search and filter files based on size.

---

### **Level 6 → Level 7**

- **What you did**: You used `find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c` to locate a file owned by `bandit7`, belonging to the `bandit6` group, and with a size of 33 bytes.
- **Why you did it**: This level requires specific file attributes. `find` lets you search the entire filesystem for files that match the given conditions, in this case, user, group, and size. It demonstrates how to use `find` with multiple filters.

---

### **Level 7 → Level 8**

- **What you did**: You searched for the term "millionth" in `data.txt` using `cat data.txt | grep millionth`.
- **Why you did it**: This is a search task. `grep` is used to search for specific text within a file. In this case, you're looking for the line that contains the word "millionth", which reveals the password.

---

### **Level 8 → Level 9**

- **What you did**: You used `sort data.txt | uniq -u` to find a unique line in `data.txt`.
- **Why you did it**: The `sort` command organizes the file, and `uniq -u` filters out duplicates, leaving only the unique line. This is useful when you need to find a specific line that doesn’t repeat, which in this case, is the password.

---

### **Level 9 → Level 10**

- **What you did**: You used `strings data.txt | grep ===` to extract human-readable strings from `data.txt` and filter the result.
- **Why you did it**: Binary files might contain hidden text that can be extracted using `strings`. Then, you use `grep` to search for a specific pattern (in this case, "==="), which reveals the password.

---

### **Level 10 → Level 11**

- **What you did**: You used `base64 -d data.txt` to decode the contents of `data.txt`, which was base64 encoded.
- **Why you did it**: The contents of the file were base64-encoded. The `base64 -d` command decodes the file to reveal the original, readable contents, which contains the password.

---

### **Level 11 → Level 12**

- **What you did**: You used `cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'` to decode a Caesar cipher (ROT13) on the file contents.
- **Why you did it**: The file's contents were encrypted with the ROT13 cipher, a simple substitution cipher. The `tr` command translates each letter into its counterpart 13 positions away in the alphabet (both uppercase and lowercase), revealing the password.

---

### **Level 12 → Level 13**

- **What you did**: You were instructed to use commands like `mkdir`, `cp`, and `mv` to organize files and directories.
- **Why you did it**: This step requires you to create, move, or copy files to get the next password. It teaches basic file management operations and helps you prepare for future levels where this knowledge is crucial.

---

### **Level 13 → Level 14**

- **What you did**: You used SSH with a private key (`ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`) to log in to the next level.
- **Why you did it**: The key here is learning how to use SSH with a private key instead of a password. This teaches you how to authenticate without a password, which is common in real-world systems for secure access.

---

### **Level 14 → Level 15**

- **What you did**: You read the password from `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` and then used `nc localhost 30000` to submit it over the network.
- **Why you did it**: In this step, you used the `nc` (netcat) tool to send the password to a service running on a specific port. It's an exercise in connecting to network services and interacting with them to pass information.

---

### **Level 15 → Level 16**

- **What you did**: You used `openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001` to connect to a server over SSL/TLS.
- **Why you did it**: This level teaches you to use `openssl s_client` to interact with a secure server (SSL/TLS). You connect to the server and extract the password from the interaction. It's an exercise in handling encrypted communication.

---

### **Level 16 → Level 17**

- **What you did**: You scanned for open ports using `nmap` and then connected to one of them with `openssl s_client`.
- **Why you did it**: `nmap` is used to scan for open ports. This is a common network exploration technique. After identifying the port, `openssl` connects to it to extract the password. It combines network scanning with secure communication.

---

### **Level 17 → Level 18**

- **What you did**: You used `diff passwords.old passwords.new` to compare two files and find the difference.
- **Why you did it**: The task is to find a small change between two files. The `diff` command shows the differences between two files line by line, revealing the password as the difference.

---

### **Level 18 → Level 19**

- **What you did**: You listed files with `ls` and then used `cat` to read the contents of the password file.
- **Why you did it**: In this level, there’s a file containing the password. You simply list the files with `ls` and use `cat` to display its contents. It’s a simple task designed to get you familiar with file handling again.

---

### **Level 19 → Level 20**

- **What you did**: You executed the `bandit20-do` binary to proceed.
- **Why you did it**: The challenge here is to execute a binary file (`bandit20-do`). Sometimes binaries require execution to perform actions and reveal the next step in a challenge.

---

### **Level 20 → Level 21**

- **What you did**: You used `ls -la` to find hidden files and then `cat` to read the password from a file.
- **Why you did it**: This is a repeat of previous concepts—finding hidden files and reading them for the next password. The important aspect here is the ability to spot hidden files (`ls -la`) and then read them.

---

### **Level 21 → Level 22**

- **What you did**: You used `su bandit22` and `sudo cat passwords.txt` to read the password file.
- **Why you did it**: The password file is protected, so you need to escalate your privileges. `su` and `sudo` are used to gain access to files or commands that require higher privileges, which is a common real-world task when handling restricted files.

---

### **Level 22 → Level 23**

- **What you did**: You read the `.bash_history` file for the password.
- **Why you did it**: The `.bash_history` file logs commands executed by a user. This step involves finding a password that was typed previously by the user.

---

### **Level 23 → Level 24**

- **What you did**: You used `strings` on binary files and `find` to locate files or directories containing the password.
- **Why you did it**: The binary file contains hidden information. Using `strings` allows you to extract human-readable text from binary files, and `find` helps you locate potentially relevant files.

---

### **Level 24 → Level 25**

- **What you did**: You checked files for symbolic links and used `strings` to read them.
- **Why you did it**: Some files are symbolic links that point to others. By checking these files and using `strings`, you can read through them to find hidden passwords or important data.

---

### **Level 25 → Level 26**

- **What you did**: You used `env` to list environment variables.
- **Why you did it**: Environment variables can sometimes contain hidden information, including passwords. By listing and inspecting them, you might find clues to the next password.

---

### **Level 26 → Level 27**

- **What you did**: You used `find . -type d -name ".git"` to find hidden `.git` directories.
- **Why you did it**: `.git` directories contain version control information. In some cases, they may have access to sensitive files or information. This step is about searching for these directories and potentially finding the password inside.

---

### **Level 27 → Level 28**

- **What you did**: You used `ls -lt` to check for file timestamps and find the newest files.
- **Why you did it**: `ls -lt` sorts files by modification time, allowing you to spot recently modified files that may contain important information. This helps in narrowing down where to look for the password.

---

### **Level 28 → Level 29**

- **What you did**: You decoded a base64-encoded string.
- **Why you did it**: The password was base64 encoded, and decoding it revealed the correct password. Base64 encoding is often used to encode binary data into readable text.

---

### **Level 29 → Level 30**

- **What you did**: You used `strings` or `file` to check the contents of a binary file.
- **Why you did it**: The binary file might contain hidden text or important clues. Using `strings` lets you pull readable strings from the binary, and `file` helps identify the file type.

---

### **Level 30 → Level 31**

- **What you did**: You used `xxd` to examine file contents.
- **Why you did it**: `xxd` creates a hex dump of a file, allowing you to view its raw content in hexadecimal form. It’s useful when dealing with binary files and might reveal hidden information.

---

### **Level 31 → Level 32**

- **What you did**: You used `xxd` to examine file contents in hexadecimal.
- **Why you did it**: Just like in the previous level, `xxd` is useful for examining binary files at a low level. In this case, it helped uncover the password hidden in a binary format.
