Documentation of Bandit Layers 1-20 (so far)
The formatting is all wrong, here is the link https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x4gUswz4xLkBjHZcMQjAqYvAS0kjlv5F2uGVs30FyoU/edit?usp=sharing 
Level 0 

ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
This essentially connects you to the game
Level 0 -> 1
ls
This is going to print out “readme”. Using this you are able to go to the next step which is
cat readme
Cat not only displays file contents but it can combine multiple files and show you the output of them.
ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
Is the password that it outputs 
Level 1 -> 2 
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
We use the same command but now we switch it to bandit 1 
ls
This is going to return us with “-”. Here if we try the “cat” command it will not return anything. 
cat ./-
we add the “./-”
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
Is the output, which is our next password. 
Level 2 -> 3
cat "spaces in this filename"
We must enter it like this because if there are spaces, it will error out. For it to work, there must be underscores or quotations. 
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
The output that we receive. 








Level 3 -> 4
Login using SSH
SSH: ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
We want to enter the directory Inhere. So we must cd.
cd inhere
Once in Inhere, we must use ls -a to show all files, including those that are hidden
ls -a
When running this command we see a file named hidden. We must cat this to read its contents. 
cat .hidden
In this folder is the password for the next level
pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB

Level 4 -> 5
Login using SSH
SSH: ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB
Once in, we want to enter the directory and print out all the files 
cd inhere
ls inhere
We want to find the human-readable file. To do this we must run the following command 
file ./*
We find only one folder in ASCII Text. This is the folder that we want to cat. 
cat ./-file07
This will output the following (password)
koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh






Level 5 -> 6
Login using SSH
SSH: ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh
We are going to want to follow the same steps as before to ls 
ls
cd inhere
ls -la
We want to find a specific file. So we can use Grep (a tool that scans through everything for you)
*/{.,}* | grep "ASCII text" | grep -v 
They give us the information that the file we are looking for only has 1033 bytes. So with this, we can further filter down our search. 
 du -b -a | grep 1033
This leaves us with only one file, so we can cat to see the contents of it. 
cat ./maybehere07/.file2
To which we receive the password for the next level. 
DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7

Level 6 -> 7
Login using SSH
SSH: ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7
Here we want to access a file that is owned by both Bandit 6 and 7. In order to do this we run the following command. 
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
Essentially this command is looking for a type f file (a file). Authorized by bandit7 and bandit6, and the file size is 33 bytes.
When we run this we get the following 
HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs




Level 7 -> 8
Login using SSH
SSH: ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs
Data.txt is a massive file, so we are going to want to use grep in order to sift down and try and find the file we want.
cat data.txt | grep millionth
This command outputted the following. 
cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV

Level 8 -> 9
Login using SSH
SSH: ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV
This level has the password stored in a unique line of text. So all we have to do here is Sort -u in order to find that unique file.
sort data.txt | uniq -u
Here we get the following outputted.
UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR

Level 9 -> 10
Login using SSH
SSH: ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR
Our goal is to find a human-readable file with a password, in order to do this we need to use the string and the grep tools.
strings data.txt | grep ===
The following is outputted.

The password that we need for this level is encrypted using base64. We need to use the following command in order to decrypt the text. First we want to cat the file and see the encrypted data.
cat data.txt
We get the following data 
VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIElGdWt3S0dzRlc4TU9xM0lSRnFyeEUxaHhUTkViVVBSCg==
This is the encrypted password that we need. So now we have to use the command/tool base64 to decrypt. 
base64 -d data.txt
The following is outputted
The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR
IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR

SSH: ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

On this level, every letter has been shifted 13 characters, this is called a cipher. To decrypt we need to use the tr command to translate. 
cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
The following is outputted.

These are some of the following commands that we are going to want to use for this level.
mkdir <path> can be used to create a new directory.
cp <source> <destination> copies files.
mv <source> <destination> moves or renames files.


Level 13 -> 14
Login using SSH
SSH: ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

We need to SSH using a public key. In order to do this we need to get the SSH key. Once we have it we will do the following. 
 ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Level 14 -> 15
Login using SSH
SSH: ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: - Use the private key from the previous level. 
We want to find the password for bandit14 so to do this we need the following command 
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
Output
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
Next, we want to submit the password on port 3000
nc localhost 30000v
Output

openssl s_client is the implementation of a client that connects to a server using SSL/TLS.
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
With that the encrypted password was shown

We want to scan open ports. We can use nmap in order to execute that. 
nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000
Now that we know what ports are open we want to use openssl again in order to connect
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
