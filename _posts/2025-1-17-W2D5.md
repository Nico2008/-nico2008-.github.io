I learned that some types of hacks are able to be executed by just trying creative things. In the case of Willow Pays, the whole database was not secure and did not need a password. This is a big flaw, and instead of acknowledging and thanking the hacker who found it, they never responded to any of his messages and figured out their own way to solve it seems like a pretty big fault. This hacker used his powers for good and reported this issue, but he didn't even receive a thank you.
