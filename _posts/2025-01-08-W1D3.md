# Cyber Security 
The thing that fascinates me the most about **[Cyber Security](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-cybersecurity.html)** is how essential it is to every single person on the planet. People use electronics every single day, and many have very little idea how they work. They just input all their information into the internet and believe it will just be kept secure. For me being able to understand how cyber security works is super important. As technology evolves and more information becomes obtainable there will be more people trying to obtain _confidential information_, and being able to keep your information secure and private will become that much harder. This field is growing and being at the forefront is going to be beneficial.
